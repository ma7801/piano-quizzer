Priority:

***FINISH implementation of different types of "sub-orders" key, type, inversion, etc.  Unfinished code in both musicData.js and ChordQuizSettings.vue
fix different height for chord abbreviation and full name

make larger for mobile screen (design mobile FIRST)
add option for audio to play or not
Add option/setting to show note names (currently always does)
find audio recordings of higher octave notes (or record them)
for practice only:
- option to have chords displayed: randomly, by fifths, by fourths, or chromatic
  - if fifths, fourths, or chromatic, show C major, then minor, then minor 7th (or whatever chord types are selected in options), then
    Db major, Db minor, Db 7th, then D major...
  - inversion option
instructions page
prevent landscape on mobile
back on main menu exits the app
add sharp chords in addition to flats (or have option to show one or the other or both)
- sharp unicode = 266F  (so '\u266f' in JS)

Cleanup:


Desired features (add AFTER bare minimum product):
Add pull to refresh
For sound
- arpeggio option before sounding chord





Issues:
-possible bug - first load on new device doesn't load settings correctly; test more



Sometime/maybe:
- desktop version has two columns so that scrolling isn't necessary
- way to keep score (will need to use honor system - like "did you get it right?")
- option to choose starting octave of audio (may require me to record the audio of all 88 keys if I do that!)
- detect audio and see if user hit the correct chord.  Resources:
