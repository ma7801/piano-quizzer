Priority:
add option for audio to play or not
Add option/setting to show note names (currently always does)
Change display names to abbreviations? Gm7 instea of G Minor 7th
possible bug - first load on new device doesn't load settings correctly; test more
find audio recordings of higher octave notes (or record them)

Cleanup:


Desired features (add AFTER bare minimum product):
Add pull to refresh
For sound
- arpeggio option before sounding chord









Sometime/maybe:
- way to keep score (will need to use honor system - like "did you get it right?")
- option to choose starting octave of audio (may require me to record the audio of all 88 keys if I do that!)
