Priority:
fix data binding in v-for in settings
- figured out a way that works - create array of objects (see code)
- create an object like the hard-coded one I have based on the musicData chordTypes object, but like:
  [ {chordTypeDisplayName: 'Major 7th', chordType: 'majorSeventh', isChecked: false},
  ...]
Create practice quiz (will use same page as quiz just act differently - no timer, button to give answer instead)
On first run, create default settings in window.localStorage








Desired features (add AFTER bare minimum product):
Add pull to refresh
Add sound
- arpeggio option before sounding chord
Make settings menu more narrow for wider screens, and possibly Chord Quiz screen also







Sometime/maybe:
-save options to local file, DB, or cookie
