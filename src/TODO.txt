PRIORITY:
finish implementing chords in order on practice
consinder removing "save" from settings screen and saving automatically after a change
make larger for mobile screen (design mobile FIRST)
add option for audio to play or not
Add option/setting to show note names (currently always does)
find audio recordings of higher octave notes (or record them)
for practice only:
instructions page
prevent landscape on mobile
back on main menu exits the app
add sharp chords in addition to flats (or have option to show one or the other or both)
- sharp unicode = 266F  (so '\u266f' in JS)
improve chords grabbed randomly so that there are not repeated chords say within 10 chords of one another; this may mean generating an entire array of
 chords instead of grabbing a new one for each "question" on the quiz or practice.

CLEANUP:


DESIRED FEATURES:
Add pull to refresh
For sound
- arpeggio option before sounding chord





ISSUES:
-possible bug - first load on new device doesn't load settings correctly; test more



SOMETIME/MAYBE:
- desktop version has two columns so that scrolling isn't necessary
- way to keep score (will need to use honor system - like "did you get it right?")
- option to choose starting octave of audio (may require me to record the audio of all 88 keys if I do that!)
- detect audio and see if user hit the correct chord.  Resources:
  - https://github.com/aubio/aubio

- allow user to specify how chords are displayed in order in practice: first by key, then by type, then by inversion, etc.
  - could use <ion-reorder-group> for this
