Priority:
On quiz:

- better colors on buttons, better font
Add option/setting to show note names (currently always does)
Change display names to abbreviations? Gm7 instea of G Minor 7th
Create practice quiz (will use same page as quiz just act differently - no timer, button to give answer instead)
possible bug - first load on new device doesn't load settings correctly; test more


Cleanup:
-I don't think I need the chord formula passed around anymore (it is returned by getRandomChord() in musicData.js)


Desired features (add AFTER bare minimum product):
Add pull to refresh
Add sound
- arpeggio option before sounding chord
- option to have on or off

Make settings menu more narrow for wider screens, and possibly Chord Quiz screen also







Sometime/maybe:
- way to keep score (will need to use honor system - like "did you get it right?")
- option to choose starting octave of audio (may require me to record the audio of all 88 keys if I do that!)
