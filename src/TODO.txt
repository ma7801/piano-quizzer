Priority:
On quiz:
- have counter for chord number/question
- quiz over text (and disable next chord button)
- implement auto-advance
Create practice quiz (will use same page as quiz just act differently - no timer, button to give answer instead)









Desired features (add AFTER bare minimum product):
Add pull to refresh
Add sound
- arpeggio option before sounding chord
Make settings menu more narrow for wider screens, and possibly Chord Quiz screen also







Sometime/maybe:
-save options to local file, DB, or cookie
