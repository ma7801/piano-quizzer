Priority:
On quiz:
- implement auto-advance
***WORKING ON THIS^^
  need to handle what happens when next chord button clicked when counting down
  need to handle end of quiz (stop auto advancing on last question)
  test and debug



- better colors on buttons, better font
Add option/setting to show note names (currently always does)
Change display names to abbreviations? Gm7 instea of G Minor 7th
Place inversion on same line as chord to save room (currenlty desktop taking needs scrolling on answer)
Create practice quiz (will use same page as quiz just act differently - no timer, button to give answer instead)
possible bug - first load on new device doesn't load settings correctly; test more


Cleanup:
-I don't think I need the chord formula passed around anymore (it is returned by getRandomChord() in musicData.js)


Desired features (add AFTER bare minimum product):
Add pull to refresh
Add sound
- arpeggio option before sounding chord
Make settings menu more narrow for wider screens, and possibly Chord Quiz screen also







Sometime/maybe:
- way to keep score (will need to use honor system - like "did you get it right?")
